This section explains how credits work, how to purchase job posting bundles, and how to manage your billing on FashionUnited.

## Understanding credits

Credits are the currency used for publishing jobs on FashionUnited. A credit is consumed each time you publish or repost a job.

| Action                | Credits consumed |
|-----------------------|------------------|
| **Publish a new job** | 1 credit         |
| **Repost a job**      | 1 credit         |

Credits are linked to your billing account, which is tied to one or more company profiles.

## Checking your credit balance

Navigate to **Jobs > Credits** in the sidebar to view your current credit balance, including available and reserved credits.

Administrators can view detailed credit usage and expiration dates under **Jobs > Used & Expiring Credits**. This helps you plan purchases before credits expire.

Each order has a status indicating where it is in the fulfillment process. Click an order to see its details or complete any pending steps.

## Managing billing accounts

Your billing account determines which company profiles can use the credits you purchase. If your organization has multiple profiles, credits may be shared or allocated separately depending on how accounts are configured.

Contact your account administrator or FashionUnited support if you need to change your billing account setup.

## Tips

- **Monitor expiration dates** — Credits may have expiration dates depending on the bundle. Check the Used & Expiring Credits page regularly.
- **Plan purchases ahead** — Purchase bundles before you need them so jobs can be published without delay.
- **Match bundles to hiring volume** — Larger bundles typically offer better per-credit pricing.
