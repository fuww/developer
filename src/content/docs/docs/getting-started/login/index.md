## Logging out

To log out, open the user menu in the dashboard and click **Log out**. This ends your session and returns you to the login page.

## Editing your user profile

After logging in, you can update your personal profile information — name, contact details, and preferences — from the user profile page. Look for your name or avatar in the top navigation to access profile settings.

## Troubleshooting login issues

- **"Invalid credentials" error** — Double-check your email and password. Passwords are case-sensitive.
- **Not receiving the reset email** — Check your spam or junk folder. The email is sent from FashionUnited.
- **Social login not working** — Make sure you originally registered with that social provider.
- **Account locked or restricted** — Contact FashionUnited support for assistance.
