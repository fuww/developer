This section gives you a tour of the FashionUnited Dashboard interface so you can quickly find the features you need.

## The dashboard home page

When you log in, you land on the Dashboard Home page. This page provides an at-a-glance summary of your job posting activity.

### Statistics widgets

The home page displays key metrics as summary cards at the top:

- **Active Jobs** — Number of currently published job postings
- **Page Views** — Total views across all your job postings
- **Apply Button Clicks** — Total clicks on the "Apply" button
- **Applicants** — Total number of applicants received
- **Reposts** — Number of job reposts
- **Job Publications** — Number of job publications

Which statistics you see depends on your account permissions. Not all widgets are visible to every user.

### Monthly trend charts

Below the summary cards, the dashboard shows 12-month trend charts for key metrics:

- Applicants per month
- Job publications per month
- Reposts per month
- Apply button clicks per month
- Page views per month

These charts help you spot trends in your recruiting activity over time.

## Sidebar navigation

The sidebar on the left is your main navigation. It is organized into sections based on feature area. The sections visible to you depend on your account roles and permissions.

### Navigation for HR managers and recruiters

The most common sidebar sections for recruiters:

| Section            | What you will find                                      |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|

| **Jobs**           | Post a Job, Jobs Table, Applicants, Upload Image, Credits |
| **Shop**           | Purchase job posting bundles and credits                |

### Additional sections

Depending on your role, you may also see:

- **News** — For editorial staff managing articles and content
- **Events** — For managing fashion industry events
- **Marketplace** — For marketplace brand management
- **User & Account** — For account administrators
- **Tools** — For internal staff (translation, AI tools, finance)

## Understanding roles and permissions

Your dashboard experience is shaped by the roles assigned to your account. There are two types:

### Scoped roles

Permissions tied to specific company profiles. For example, you may have permission to manage jobs and applicants for "Company A" but not "Company B."

### Global roles

Platform-wide permissions typically held by FashionUnited internal staff or administrators.

If you cannot see a feature described in this guide, your account may not have the required role. Contact your account administrator or FashionUnited support.
