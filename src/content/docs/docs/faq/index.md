Frequently asked questions about using the FashionUnited Dashboard.

## Account & Login

### How do I create a FashionUnited Dashboard account?

You can register at `dashboard.fashionunited.com` using your email address, or sign up with Google or LinkedIn. See [Logging In](/docs/getting-started/login/) for step-by-step instructions.

### I forgot my password. How do I reset it?

Go to the login page and click **Forgot password?** to request a reset email. See [Resetting your password](/docs/getting-started/login/#resetting-your-password) for details.

### Why can I not see certain features in the dashboard?

The dashboard is role-based. Features visible to you depend on the roles assigned to your account. If you need access to a feature, contact your account administrator or FashionUnited support. See [Understanding roles and permissions](/docs/getting-started/dashboard-overview/#understanding-roles-and-permissions) for more.

### Can I link my Google or LinkedIn account after registering with email?

Social login is set up during registration. Contact FashionUnited support if you need to change your login method.

## Jobs

### How do I post a new job?

Navigate to **Jobs > Post a Job** in the sidebar and fill in the job form. See [Posting a Job](/docs/dashboard-jobs/posting-a-job/) for a complete walkthrough.

### What are locales, and how many should I select?

Locales are country/language combinations that determine where your job appears on FashionUnited. For example, selecting `en-US` publishes the job on the US English career page. Select all locales relevant to your target candidates. FashionUnited supports 50+ locales.

### What is the difference between unpublishing and deleting a job?

**Unpublishing** removes the job from public view but keeps it in your Jobs Table. You can re-publish it later. Jobs cannot be permanently deleted through the dashboard — they can only be unpublished or allowed to expire.

### How do I repost an expired job?

Open the Jobs Table, find the expired job, and select **Repost** from the job actions menu. Reposting consumes a credit. See [Job actions](/docs/dashboard-jobs/posting-a-job/#job-actions) for details.

### What are credits and how are they consumed?

Credits are units of posting currency. One credit is consumed each time you publish or repost a job. You can purchase credits through the Shop. See your credits balance under **Jobs > Credits**.

### Can I edit a job after it is published?

Yes. Find the job in the Jobs Table and click **Edit** to open the job form with the current details pre-filled. Your changes are reflected on the live posting after saving.

### What is the AI-assisted description feature?

When creating a job, you can use the built-in AI tool to generate or improve your job description based on the title and other details you have entered. It is optional — you can always write descriptions manually.

## Applicants

### How do I see applicants for my jobs?

Navigate to **Jobs > Applicants** in the sidebar. You will see all applicants across your job postings. Use filters to narrow by job, status, or date. See [Managing Applications](/docs/dashboard-jobs/managing-applications/).

### Can I message an applicant directly?

Yes, if your account has the "Send message to applicant" permission. Open the applicant detail view and use the message function. See [Sending a message to an applicant](/docs/dashboard-jobs/managing-applications/#sending-a-message-to-an-applicant).

### How do I download an applicant's CV?

Open the applicant detail view and look for the documents section. You can download the CV, cover letter, and any extra documents from there. Document access requires the appropriate account permission.

### What do the applicant statuses mean?

Statuses represent stages in your hiring workflow — for example: New, Reviewed, Shortlisted, Rejected, Hired. You can change an applicant's status from the detail view. See [Changing applicant status](/docs/dashboard-jobs/managing-applications/#changing-applicant-status).

## Credits & Billing

### How do I purchase credits?

Navigate to **Shop** in the sidebar to browse available bundles. Select a bundle, complete the checkout, and credits are added to your account. See [Credits & Billing](/docs/billing/credits-and-billing/) for details.

### How do I check my credit balance?

Go to **Jobs > Credits** in the sidebar to see your available credits. Administrators can also view expiring credits under **Jobs > Used & Expiring Credits**.

### Do credits expire?

Credits may have expiration dates depending on the bundle purchased. Check the Used & Expiring Credits page for details on upcoming expirations.

## Company Profile

### How do I update my company logo or images?

Navigate to the company profile editor from your dashboard. You can upload a new logo, desktop and mobile header images, and collection images. See [Editing Your Profile](/docs/company-profile/editing-your-profile/).

### What image formats and sizes are recommended?

See [Logo requirements](/docs/logo/) and [Header image requirements](/docs/header/) for detailed specifications.

## Statistics & Analytics

### What statistics are available on the dashboard?

The dashboard shows active jobs, page views, apply button clicks, applicant counts, reposts, and job publications — both as totals and as 12-month trend charts. See [Job Analytics](/docs/dashboard-jobs/job-analytics/).

### Why do I not see all statistics?

Statistics visibility is role-based. You may only see a subset depending on your account permissions. See [Role-based visibility](/docs/dashboard-jobs/job-analytics/#role-based-visibility).

## Technical

### What browsers are supported?

See [System Requirements and Browsers](/docs/system-requirements-and-browsers/) for supported browsers and versions.

### Who do I contact for support?

For technical issues or account questions, use the **Contact** link in the dashboard sidebar or reach out to your FashionUnited account manager.
