---

This section walks you through creating and publishing a job posting on FashionUnited.

## Before you start

To post a job, you need:

- A FashionUnited Dashboard account with job posting permissions
- At least one company profile linked to your account
- Available credits in your account (a credit is consumed when a job is published)

If you do not have credits, visit the [Shop](/docs/billing/credits-and-billing/) to purchase a bundle.

## Starting a new job posting

Navigate to **Jobs > Post a Job** in the sidebar to open the job form.

## Selecting a company profile

If your account is linked to multiple company profiles, select which company this job is for. The selected profile determines the company name, logo, and branding shown on the published job.

## Using a template (optional)

If your organization has saved job templates, select one to pre-fill the form. Templates save time when posting similar roles repeatedly.

Templates are managed under **Jobs > Templates** (requires admin access).

## Selecting a billing account

If your account is linked to multiple billing accounts, select the account to charge for this posting. The selected account must have available credits. For more information, see [Credits & Billing](/docs/billing/credits-and-billing/).

## Filling in the job form

### Job title

Enter a clear, descriptive job title. This is the main heading candidates will see.

### Job description

Write or paste the full job description. The editor supports rich text formatting.

**AI-assisted description generation:** The job form includes an AI tool that can generate or improve your job description based on the title and details you have entered. Click the AI button next to the description field to use it.

### Location

Specify where the job is based:

- **Country** — Required. Select from the dropdown.
- **City** — The city where the role is located.
- **Address and building** — Optional. Useful for on-site roles.
- **Region** — The broader region or state.
- **Geolocation** — The form can automatically validate and geocode the address you enter.

### Categories

Select one or more job categories that best describe the role. Categories help candidates find your job through search and filters.

Available categories include: Design & Creative, Buying, Marketing, Retail, E-commerce, and more.

### Locales

Locales are the country/language combinations where your job will be published. FashionUnited supports 50+ locales across all continents. Each locale makes the job visible on that country's FashionUnited career page.

Select all locales that match your target candidates. For example, select `en-US` for the United States and `de-DE` for Germany.

A credit is consumed when the job is published.
