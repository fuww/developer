## Applicants list overview

The applicants list shows all applications for jobs linked to your company profiles. Each entry displays key information at a glance, including the applicant's name, the job they applied for, their current status, and the application date.

## Filtering applicants

Use the filters at the top of the list to narrow down applicants.

### Filter by company profile

If you manage multiple company profiles, filter to see applicants for a specific company only.

### Filter by applicant status

Filter by workflow status to focus on applicants at a particular stage — for example, show only "New" applicants or only "Reviewed" ones.

### Filter by job

View applicants for a specific job posting.

### Filter by date range

Narrow the list to applicants who applied within a specific time period.

### Viewing documents

If the applicant uploaded documents, you can access them from the detail view:

- **CV / Resume** — The applicant's curriculum vitae
- **Cover letter** — A formal cover letter document (if uploaded separately)
- **Extra documents** — Any additional files the applicant attached

Document access requires the appropriate permission on your account.

## Changing applicant status

Move applicants through your hiring workflow by updating their status. The available statuses represent stages in the review process — for example: New, Reviewed, Shortlisted, Rejected, Hired.

To change a status:

1. Open the applicant detail view.
2. Select the new status from the status dropdown.
3. The change saves automatically.

## Sending a message to an applicant

You can message applicants directly from the dashboard:

1. Open the applicant detail view.
2. Click **Send message**.
3. Select a message reason from the template options (e.g., interview invitation, rejection, request for more information).
4. Write or customize your message.
5. Click **Send**.

Message reasons help categorize your communications and keep your outreach consistent.

> **Note:** Messaging requires the "Send message to applicant" permission on your account. If you do not see this option, contact your account administrator.

## Sharing an applicant link

To share a specific applicant with a colleague:

1. Open the applicant detail view.
2. Click **Copy link** to copy a direct URL to this applicant.
3. Share the link. The recipient needs dashboard access and appropriate permissions to view the applicant.

## Tips for efficient applicant management

- **Keep statuses current** — Update statuses so your team knows where each applicant stands
- **Use filters** — When managing multiple jobs, filter by job or status to stay organized
