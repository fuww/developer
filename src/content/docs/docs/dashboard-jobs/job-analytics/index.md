This section explains how to understand and use the job performance data available in the FashionUnited Dashboard.

## Dashboard home statistics

The Dashboard Home page provides a high-level overview of your job posting performance. See [Dashboard Overview](/docs/getting-started/dashboard-overview/) for a full tour of this page.

## Key metrics explained

### Active jobs

The number of job postings currently published and visible to candidates on FashionUnited.

### Page views

The total number of times your job postings have been viewed by candidates. This counts each visit to a job detail page.

### Apply button clicks

The number of times candidates clicked the "Apply" button on your job postings. A high click count relative to page views indicates your job descriptions are compelling.

### Applicants

The total number of completed applications received across all your job postings. Compare this to apply button clicks to understand how many candidates complete the application after clicking.

### Reposts

The number of times your jobs have been reposted (re-published after expiration or unpublishing). Useful for tracking how often roles are being recycled.

### Job publications

The total number of job publications, including first-time publications and reposts.

## Monthly trend charts

The dashboard home shows 12-month trend charts for each of the key metrics above. These charts help you:

- **Spot seasonal patterns** — Identify which months see more candidate activity
- **Measure campaign impact** — See whether changes to your job postings affect views or applications
- **Track growth** — Monitor whether your recruiting reach is growing over time

## Per-job statistics in the Jobs Table

The Jobs Table (**Jobs > Jobs Table**) shows performance metrics for each individual job posting:

| Column                  | What it shows                                     |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Views**               | Number of times this specific job was viewed      |
| **Apply Button Clicks** | Number of apply button clicks for this job        |
| **Applicants**          | Number of applicants for this job                 |

Sort and filter the table to identify your best and worst performing postings.

### Comparing jobs

Sort the Jobs Table by views, apply button clicks, or applicants to quickly see which jobs attract the most attention. This can help you:

- Identify which job titles and descriptions resonate with candidates
- Understand which locales generate the most interest
- Decide which jobs to repost or highlight

## Understanding the numbers

### What affects page views?

- The number of locales the job is published in
- Whether the job is highlighted (promoted)
- How recently the job was published (newer jobs appear higher in search results)
- The attractiveness of the job title

### What affects apply button clicks?

- The quality and clarity of the job description
- Salary and benefits information
- Company reputation and profile completeness
- Location desirability

### What affects applicant count?

- The simplicity of the application process (simpler forms get more completions)
- Whether the apply button links to FashionUnited's built-in application form or an external URL

## Role-based visibility

Not all statistics are visible to every user. What you see depends on your account roles:

| Role             | Statistics visible                            |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Job Statistics** | Active jobs, page views, apply button clicks  |
| **Applicants**     | Applicant count and monthly applicant chart   |
| **Transactions**   | Reposts, job publications, and monthly charts |

If you are missing expected statistics, check with your account administrator about your role assignments.
