This section explains how to edit your company profile on FashionUnited. Your company profile — also called your Branding Page — is your employer presence on the FashionUnited career site. It appears alongside every job you post and on a dedicated company page that candidates can visit directly.

## Why your company profile matters

A complete and well-branded profile:

- Builds trust with candidates viewing your job postings
- Showcases your brand identity with images and descriptions
- Helps your company stand out in a competitive hiring market

## Accessing the profile editor

Navigate to the company profile edit page from your dashboard. If you manage multiple company profiles, select the one you want to edit.

> **Note:** You need edit permissions on a company profile to access the editor. If you cannot access it, contact your account administrator.

1. Click the logo area or the upload button.
2. Select an image file from your computer.
3. Adjust the crop if needed.
4. Click **Save**.

## Editing the company description

Write a compelling company description that tells candidates who you are, what you do, and why they should want to work for you. The editor supports rich text formatting.

Tips for an effective description:

- Start with a brief overview of your company
- Highlight what makes your workplace unique
- Mention your industry focus and market position
- Keep it concise — candidates scan, they do not read every word

2. Click **Add image**.
3. Select and upload the image.
4. Drag images to reorder them if needed.

### Removing collection images

1. Hover over the image you want to remove.
2. Click the delete button.
3. Confirm the removal.
