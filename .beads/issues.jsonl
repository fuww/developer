Patch update fixes edge cases in image resizing.\n\n**starlight-theme-next**: A Starlight theme plugin that provides design refinements. This is configured in astro.config.mjs as a Starlight plugin.\n\n**framer-motion**: Used only in the developer repo (not in about) for the Vortex animation component (src/components/ui/vortex.tsx) and the registration page. Since the about repo doesn't use it, check for the latest version independently rather than matching about. The ^12.23.24 range will auto-resolve to latest 12.x, so this may not need an explicit bump — just verify.\n\n## Implementation\n\nEdit package.json — update version strings. For framer-motion, check if ^12.23.24 already resolves to a newer version via bun install (it likely does since it's a caret range covering the entire 12.x line).\n\n## Risk\n\nVERY LOW — All patch updates.\n\n## Files\n\n- package.json (dependencies section)","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"j@jlnw.nl","created_at":"2026-02-18T11:56:44.503760467Z","created_by":"Joost van der Laan","updated_at":"2026-02-18T12:21:26.744885661Z","closed_at":"2026-02-18T12:21:26.744885661Z","close_reason":"Updated all dependency versions to match about repo","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"developer-2ai","depends_on_id":"developer-8lb","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-18T11:58:53.331381857Z","created_by":"Joost van der Laan"}]}

All version changes can be reviewed together before installing\n2. A single bun install resolves everything at once (faster, avoids intermediate broken states)\n3. The lockfile (bun.lock) is updated atomically\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. Run `bun install` in the project root\n2. Verify no peer dependency warnings or conflicts in the output\n3. Check that bun.lock was updated (it should show changes for all bumped packages)\n4. Run `bunx playwright install` to download browser binaries matching Playwright 1.57\n5. Run `astro check` (via `bun run astro check`) to verify TypeScript types still resolve\n6. Run `bun run build` to verify the production build succeeds\n\n## What Could Go Wrong\n\n- **Peer dependency conflicts**: Starlight 0.37 might have stricter peer dep requirements on Astro version. Our Astro version (5.16.13) should satisfy it, but check.\n- **astro-vtbot v2 import resolution**: After moving to devDependencies, verify the component imports in Head.astro still resolve at build time.\n- **starlight-llms-txt v0.6 config**: The rawContent option might have a different API than expected. Verify the build doesn't error on this plugin.\n- **Type errors**: astro check may surface new type issues from updated @types or stricter type exports.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- `bun install` completes without errors\n- `astro check` passes (or only has pre-existing warnings)\n- `bun run build` completes successfully\n- No new console warnings about deprecated APIs\n\n## Files\n\n- bun.lock (auto-generated)\n- No source file changes","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"j@jlnw.nl","created_at":"2026-02-18T11:56:59.863911531Z","created_by":"Joost van der Laan","updated_at":"2026-02-18T12:23:14.63795766Z","closed_at":"2026-02-18T12:23:14.63795766Z","close_reason":"bun install, astro check, and bun run build all pass successfully.

{"id":"developer-8lb","title":"EPIC: Align Developer Portal with About Repo — Dependency Updates \u0026 Copy-to-Markdown","description":"## Overview\n\nThis epic brings the FashionUnited Developer Portal (/home/joost/fuww/developer) into alignment with the About/Handbook site (/home/joost/fuww/about) in two key areas:\n\n1. **Dependency updates**: The developer repo has fallen behind the about repo on ~20+ shared dependencies. The about repo completed a major upgrade in commit a4299053 (Jan 23, 2026). We need to match those versions to stay on the same Astro/Starlight ecosystem baseline across all FashionUnited properties.\n\n2. **Copy-to-Markdown feature**: The about repo added a 'Copy page' dropdown button on every documentation page (commit 30150cb0, Oct 20, 2025, bug-fixed in 599e8cf7 Feb 13, 2026). This lets users copy entire page content as Markdown (useful for LLMs, sharing, offline reference) or view the raw Markdown in a new tab. This feature should be consistent across all FashionUnited documentation sites.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\n- **Ecosystem consistency**: All FashionUnited Astro/Starlight sites should run on the same dependency baseline. Drift creates maintenance burden and makes porting features harder.\n- **Developer experience**: The copy-to-markdown feature is particularly valuable for a *developer* portal — developers frequently need to share API docs, paste into LLM contexts, or reference documentation in issues/PRs.\n- **LLM-friendly content**: Combined with the starlight-llms-txt plugin upgrade (0.2→0.6), this makes the developer docs fully LLM-accessible at page level (copy button) and site level (llms.txt).\n\n## Scope\n\n### In scope:\n- All dependency version updates to match about repo\n- astro-vtbot v1→v2 migration (dependency type change + config)\n- starlight-llms-txt 0.2→0.6 migration (add rawContent option)\n- PageTitle component with Copy Page dropdown\n- Markdown API endpoint ([...slug].md.ts)\n- Astro config registration of new component\n- Build verification and E2E test pass\n\n### Out of scope (noted for future work):\n- Security middleware \u0026 CSP headers (about has middleware.ts; developer does not)\n- StructuredData.astro for JSON-LD schemas\n- SkipLink.astro for keyboard accessibility\n- LastUpdated.astro freshness badges\n- PageSidebar.astro maintainers card\n- Vitest unit testing infrastructure\n- Multi-browser Playwright expansion\n- Content schema extensions (maintainers, needsReview, tokens)\n- PostHog analytics integration\n\n## Reference\n\n- About repo: /home/joost/fuww/about\n- About repo upgrade commit: a4299053 (Jan 23, 2026)\n- About repo PageTitle commit: 30150cb0 (Oct 20, 2025)\n- About repo copy button fix: 599e8cf7 (Feb 13, 2026)\n- About repo vtbot migration: ce04b8d4","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"j@jlnw.nl","created_at":"2026-02-18T11:54:51.489504702Z","created_by":"Joost van der Laan","updated_at":"2026-02-18T11:54:51.489504702Z","comments":[{"id":1,"issue_id":"developer-8lb","author":"Joost van der Laan","text":"## Architectural Context\n\nThe FashionUnited ecosystem has multiple Astro/Starlight documentation sites:\n- **about** (handbook): /home/joost/fuww/about — internal handbook, HR docs, AI prompts library\n- **developer** (this repo): /home/joost/fuww/developer — developer portal, API docs, integration guides\n\nBoth sites share the same tech stack (Astro + Starlight + Tailwind + React/shadcn) and should maintain feature parity on shared infrastructure features like copy-to-markdown, LLM-friendly content generation, and dependency baselines.\n\nThe about repo is generally the 'lead' repo where new features are prototyped and proven before being ported to other properties.

{"id":"developer-9tb","title":"Create [...slug].md.ts markdown API endpoint","description":"## What\n\nCreate a new dynamic API route at `src/pages/[...slug].md.ts` that serves raw markdown content for any documentation page. This endpoint powers the 'Copy page as Markdown' and 'View as Markdown' features in the PageTitle dropdown.\n\n## How It Works\n\nWhen a user clicks 'Copy page' on e.g. `/docs/marketplace/graphql-api/`, the client-side JavaScript fetches `/docs/marketplace/graphql-api.md`. This endpoint:\n\n1. Extracts the slug from the URL params\n2. Looks up the matching entry in the `docs` content collection\n3. Returns the raw markdown body as plain text\n\n## Implementation\n\n```typescript\nimport type { APIRoute } from 'astro';\nimport { getCollection } from 'astro:content';\n\nexport const prerender = false;\n\nexport const GET: APIRoute = async ({ params }) =\u003e {\n  const slug = params.slug || '';\n  const docs = await getCollection('docs');\n  const doc = docs.find(entry =\u003e entry.slug === slug);\n\n  if (\\!doc) {\n    return new Response('Not found', { status: 404 });\n  }\n\n  return new Response(doc.body, {\n    status: 200,\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'text/plain; charset=utf-8',\n    },\n  });\n};\n\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  const docs = await getCollection('docs');\n  return docs.map(entry =\u003e ({\n    params: { slug: entry.slug },\n  }));\n}\n```\n\n## Technical Notes\n\n### Why prerender = false?\n\nThe developer repo uses `output: 'server'` mode (SSR via Node.js adapter). With `prerender = false`, this endpoint is handled at runtime by the Node server rather than pre-generated at build time. This means:\n- New docs added to the content collection are immediately available\n- No need to rebuild to update markdown endpoints\n- Follows the same pattern as the existing `src/pages/api/auth/signout.ts` endpoint\n\n### Why getStaticPaths() if prerender is false?\n\nAstro requires getStaticPaths for [...slug] routes even in server mode as a fallback mechanism. It's used for type inference and as a hint for which paths exist.\n\n### Content Collection Structure\n\nThe developer repo's docs live in `src/content/docs/` with slugs like:\n- `docs/introduction`\n- `docs/marketplace/graphql-api`\n- `docs/getting-started/login`\n- `posts/new-api-features`\n\nThe [...slug] catch-all pattern handles all nesting levels.\n\n### URL Mapping\n\nThe client-side code strips trailing slashes before appending .md:\n`window.location.pathname.replace(/\\/$/, '') + '.md'`\n\nSo `/docs/marketplace/` → fetch `/docs/marketplace.md` → slug = `docs/marketplace`\n\n## Astro Content API Note\n\n`doc.body` returns the raw markdown source (everything after the frontmatter YAML). It does NOT include the frontmatter itself. This is intentional — the markdown is meant to be the page content for LLM consumption, not the metadata.\n\n## Reference\n\nPorted from: /home/joost/fuww/about/src/pages/[...slug].md.ts\n\n## Files\n\n- src/pages/[...slug].md.ts (NEW)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"j@jlnw.nl","created_at":"2026-02-18T11:57:32.597530674Z","created_by":"Joost van der Laan","updated_at":"2026-02-18T11:57:32.597530674Z","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"developer-9tb","depends_on_id":"developer-8lb","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-18T11:58:53.752646454Z","created_by":"Joost van der Laan"}],"comments":[{"id":7,"issue_id":"developer-9tb","author":"Joost van der Laan","text":"## Cross-References\n- Parent epic: developer-8lb\n- Blocks: developer-exi (PageTitle component)\n- Parallel with: developer-q74 (constants.ts)\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n### Why a dynamic SSR route vs static pre-rendered?\nThe developer repo runs in SSR mode (output: 'server'). Using prerender=false means the markdown is always fresh — if someone edits a doc and restarts the server, the .md endpoint immediately reflects the change. For a developer portal where docs may be updated frequently (API changes, new endpoints), this freshness guarantee is valuable.\n\n### Why not just use the DOM content?\nWe could have the copy button scrape the rendered HTML and convert it back to markdown. But:\n1. That loses markdown structure (headers, code fences, links)\n2. Conversion is lossy and error-prone\n3. The Content Collection API gives us the EXACT source markdown\n4. Raw markdown is more useful for LLMs than cleaned-up HTML\n\n### Why text/plain instead of text/markdown?\nThe Content-Type header uses text/plain rather than text/markdown because:\n1. text/markdown is not universally recognized by browsers\n2. text/plain causes browsers to display the content directly (useful for 'View as Markdown')\n3. The Clipboard API doesn't care about Content-Type — it writes the text body regardless\n\n### Why getStaticPaths() is included\nEven though prerender=false, Astro's type system expects getStaticPaths for [...slug] routes. It provides TypeScript type inference for the params object and serves as documentation of expected routes.","created_at":"2026-02-18T11:59:58Z"}]}

{"id":"developer-eeb","title":"Migrate astro-vtbot v1 → v2","description":"## What\n\nMigrate astro-vtbot from v1 (^1.8.2) to v2 (^2.1.10). This is a **major version bump** with specific migration steps.\n\n## Breaking Changes in v2\n\n1. **Dependency type change**: vtbot moves from `dependencies` to `devDependencies`. In v2, vtbot is a build-time-only tool — it doesn't need to be bundled in production. This reduces the production bundle size.\n\n2. **Default options reversed**:\n   - v1: `autoLint: true`, `loadingIndicator: true` (auto-injected)\n   - v2: `autoLint: false`, `loadingIndicator: false` (must be explicit)\n   - **Impact for us**: Our Head.astro already explicitly imports and renders LoadingIndicator, so this default change doesn't affect us. The component is included because we put it in our template, not because vtbot auto-injects it.\n\n3. **Integration removal optional**: The about repo removed `import vtbot` and `vtbot()` from astro.config.mjs entirely. For basic Starlight usage, the integration is no longer needed — the components work standalone. However, keeping the integration is also fine (it still works in v2).\n\n## How the About Repo Handled It\n\nCommit ce04b8d4: Moved vtbot to devDependencies, updated version, removed from astro.config.mjs integrations. No changes needed to Head.astro — the component imports (`VtbotStarlight`, `LoadingIndicator`) remain identical.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. In package.json:\n   - Remove `astro-vtbot` from `dependencies`\n   - Add `astro-vtbot: \"^2.1.10\"` to `devDependencies`\n\n2. In astro.config.mjs:\n   - Remove `import vtbot from \"astro-vtbot\"` (line 9)\n   - Remove `vtbot()` from the integrations array\n   - This is the approach the about repo uses\n\n3. In src/components/starlight/Head.astro:\n   - **No changes needed** — the imports still work:\n     - `import VtbotStarlight from \"astro-vtbot/components/starlight/Base.astro\"`\n     - `import LoadingIndicator from \"astro-vtbot/components/LoadingIndicator.astro\"`\n\n## Why Not Keep the Integration?\n\nThe vtbot() integration in v2 only provides:\n- Dev toolbar inspection chamber\n- Optional auto-lint\n- Optional auto-injection of LoadingIndicator\n\nSince we manually include LoadingIndicator and don't rely on auto-lint, removing the integration simplifies our config and matches the about repo's approach. The dev toolbar is minor and not used.\n\n## Risk\n\nMEDIUM — Major version bump, but our investigation confirmed all component APIs are unchanged. The about repo has been running v2 since January 2026. The key risk is forgetting to move the package to devDependencies.\n\n## Files\n\n- package.json (move between dep sections + version bump)\n- astro.config.mjs (remove import + integration)\n- src/components/starlight/Head.astro (NO CHANGES — verify only)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"j@jlnw.nl","created_at":"2026-02-18T11:55:37.529538255Z","created_by":"Joost van der Laan","updated_at":"2026-02-18T12:16:10.074585585Z","closed_at":"2026-02-18T12:16:10.074585585Z","close_reason":"Migrated astro-vtbot v1→v2: moved to devDependencies with ^2.1.10, removed vtbot integration from astro.config.mjs, Head.astro unchanged","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"developer-eeb","depends_on_id":"developer-8lb","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-18T11:58:47.566421117Z","created_by":"Joost van der Laan"}],"comments":[{"id":5,"issue_id":"developer-eeb","author":"Joost van der Laan","text":"## Cross-References\n- Parent epic: developer-8lb\n- Blocks: developer-34v (bun install verification)\n- About repo reference commit: ce04b8d4\n\n## Key Insight\nThe reason vtbot moves to devDependencies in v2 is that the Astro build system inlines the component code at build time. The vtbot package is only needed during the build process (to resolve the imports), not at runtime. This is a common pattern in Astro where component libraries are dev-only because Astro compiles everything to static/server output.\n\n## Verification After Implementation\nAfter this change, verify that `grep -r 'astro-vtbot' node_modules/.package-lock.json` still shows the package (it should — devDependencies are still installed by bun install, they're just not included in production Docker images if you use --production flag).","created_at":"2026-02-18T11:59:33Z"}]}
{"id":"developer-exi","title":"Create PageTitle.astro component with Copy Page dropdown","description":"## What\n\nCreate `src/components/starlight/PageTitle.astro` — a custom Starlight component override that replaces the default page title with an enhanced version featuring a 'Copy page' dropdown menu.\n\n## Feature Description\n\nThe dropdown appears next to every page's h1 title and offers two actions:\n\n1. **Copy page** — Fetches the page's raw markdown from the .md endpoint and copies it to the clipboard using the Clipboard API. Shows 'Copied!' feedback for 2 seconds. Useful for pasting docs into LLM prompts, issues, PRs, or sharing.\n\n2. **View as Markdown** — Opens the raw markdown in a new browser tab. Useful for reading the source, saving locally, or using with tools that consume plain text.\n\n## Why This Matters for a Developer Portal\n\nDevelopers are the primary audience for this site. They frequently:\n- Paste API documentation into ChatGPT/Claude to ask questions about it\n- Reference docs in GitHub issues and pull requests (markdown format is ideal)\n- Feed documentation to code generation tools\n- Share doc excerpts in Slack/Teams (markdown renders well in both)\n- Use docs as context for their own documentation\n\nThe 'Copy page' button eliminates the friction of manually selecting, copying, and cleaning up page content. The markdown format is already structured and LLM-ready.\n\n## Component Architecture\n\n```\nPageTitle.astro\n├── \u003cdiv.page-title-wrapper\u003e     (flex container: title + button)\n│   ├── \u003ch1 id=PAGE_TITLE_ID\u003e   (page title from Starlight route data)\n│   └── \u003cdiv.copy-page-container\u003e (dropdown positioning context)\n│       ├── \u003cbutton.copy-page-button\u003e  (trigger: icon + text + chevron)\n│       └── \u003cdiv.dropdown-menu\u003e        (hidden by default)\n│           ├── \u003cbutton data-action='copy-markdown'\u003e  (Copy page)\n│           └── \u003cbutton data-action='view-markdown'\u003e  (View as Markdown)\n├── \u003cscript\u003e                      (client-side dropdown + clipboard logic)\n└── \u003cstyle\u003e                       (scoped CSS using Starlight variables)\n```\n\n## Key Implementation Details\n\n### Imports\n```typescript\nimport { PAGE_TITLE_ID } from '../constants.ts';\nconst title = Astro.locals.starlightRoute.entry.data.title;\n```\n\n### Client-Side Behavior\n- **Dropdown toggle**: Click button → show/hide menu, update aria-expanded\n- **Outside click close**: Document click listener closes dropdown\n- **Copy action**: Fetches `window.location.pathname.replace(/\\/$/, '') + '.md'`, writes to clipboard\n- **View action**: Opens the .md URL in \\_blank tab\n- **View transitions compatibility**: Listens to both DOMContentLoaded and astro:page-load (for Astro view transitions / vtbot navigation)\n- **Listener deduplication**: Clones button node to prevent duplicate listeners on re-navigation\n\n### Accessibility\n- button has aria-label, aria-expanded, aria-haspopup='menu'\n- dropdown has role='menu', aria-label\n- menu items have role='menuitem'\n- SVG icons have aria-hidden='true'\n- Keyboard-navigable (native button elements)\n\n### Styling\n- Uses Starlight CSS custom properties (--sl-color-*) for theme consistency\n- Respects dark mode automatically via Starlight variables\n- Responsive: on mobile (\u003c768px), button text hides (icon only), dropdown repositions from right-aligned to left-aligned\n- Smooth transitions on hover (0.2s)\n- z-index: 100 for dropdown overlay\n\n### SVG Icons\nThree inline SVGs used (no external icon library dependency):\n1. Document icon (lines on page) — main button + copy action\n2. Eye icon (circle in oval) — view action\n3. Chevron down — dropdown indicator with hover animation\n\n## Reference\n\nPorted from: /home/joost/fuww/about/src/components/starlight/PageTitle.astro\nBug fix applied from: /home/joost/fuww/about commit 599e8cf7 (copy button visibility)\n\n## Files\n\n- src/components/starlight/PageTitle.astro (NEW)","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"j@jlnw.nl","created_at":"2026-02-18T11:58:01.364450439Z","created_by":"Joost van der Laan","updated_at":"2026-02-18T11:58:01.364450439Z","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"developer-exi","depends_on_id":"developer-q74","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-18T11:58:46.682515979Z","created_by":"Joost van der Laan"},{"issue_id":"developer-exi","depends_on_id":"developer-9tb","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-18T11:58:46.829773085Z","created_by":"Joost van der Laan"},{"issue_id":"developer-exi","depends_on_id":"developer-8lb","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-18T11:58:53.889763629Z","created_by":"Joost van der Laan"}],"comments":[{"id":8,"issue_id":"developer-exi","author":"Joost van der Laan","text":"## Cross-References\n- Parent epic: developer-8lb\n- Depends on: developer-q74 (constants.ts), developer-9tb (markdown endpoint)\n- Blocks: developer-ypr (config registration)\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n### Why inline SVGs instead of Lucide icons?\nThe about repo uses inline SVGs rather than importing from lucide-react because:\n1. Astro components (.astro) can render inline SVGs directly without React overhead\n2. Only 3 simple icons are needed (document, eye, chevron) — no need for a full icon library import\n3. Inline SVGs are smaller than component imports for small icon counts\n4. They render during SSR without hydration — no JavaScript needed for icons\n\n### Why clone the button to remove listeners?\nThe script uses `button.cloneNode(true)` + `replaceChild` to prevent duplicate event listeners. This is necessary because:\n1. Astro view transitions re-run page scripts on navigation\n2. The astro:page-load event fires on every navigation\n3. Without deduplication, each navigation would add ANOTHER click listener\n4. Cloning the node effectively removes all existing listeners before adding new ones\n\n### Accessibility Rationale\nThe ARIA implementation follows the WAI-ARIA Menu Button pattern:\n- Button: aria-haspopup='menu' (tells screen readers a menu will open)\n- Button: aria-expanded (dynamically updated to reflect menu state)\n- Menu: role='menu' (identifies the dropdown as a menu widget)\n- Items: role='menuitem' (identifies each option as a menu action)\nThis ensures screen reader users can discover and operate the dropdown.\n\n### Responsive Design Approach\nOn mobile (\u003c768px):\n- The 'Copy page' text is hidden, leaving only the document icon\n- This keeps the button compact and doesn't compete with the page title for space\n- The dropdown menu shifts from right-aligned to left-aligned to stay on screen\n- The full dropdown text remains visible — only the trigger button is condensed","created_at":"2026-02-18T11:59:58Z"}]}

{"id":"developer-y3z","title":"Upgrade starlight-llms-txt 0.2 → 0.6 with rawContent option","description":"## What\n\nUpdate starlight-llms-txt from ^0.2.0 to ^0.6.1 and add the `rawContent: true` configuration option.\n\n## Why\n\nstarlight-llms-txt generates /llms.txt, /llms-full.txt, and /llms-small.txt endpoints that make the entire site's documentation accessible to LLMs in a structured format. This is complementary to the per-page copy-to-markdown feature — llms-txt handles site-level access, copy-to-markdown handles page-level access.\n\nVersion 0.6 adds:\n- `rawContent` option: Returns raw markdown instead of trying to render MDX/React components to HTML. This is CRITICAL for sites with React components in MDX — without it, llms-full.txt may fail or produce garbage when encountering JSX.\n- `promote`/`demote` options: Control page ordering in generated txt files\n- `pageSeparator` option: Custom separator between pages\n- `customSets` support: Generate subset txt files for specific doc sections\n\n## About Repo Experience\n\nThe about repo hit a bug where React components in MDX caused llms-full.txt rendering to fail. Commit 7be27ff3 (Feb 13, 2026) fixed this by adding `rawContent: true`. The developer repo also uses React components in MDX (the vortex component, shadcn/ui components), so we should proactively add this option.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. In package.json: Update `starlight-llms-txt` from `^0.2.0` to `^0.6.1`\n\n2. In astro.config.mjs: Change the plugin configuration from:\n```js\nplugins: [starlightLlmsTxt()],\n```\nto:\n```js\nplugins: [\n  starlightLlmsTxt({\n    rawContent: true,\n  }),\n],\n```\n\n## Backward Compatibility\n\nAll existing v0.2 routes (/llms.txt, /llms-full.txt, /llms-small.txt) continue to work. The `rawContent` option is additive — it changes the content format of llms-full.txt from rendered HTML to raw markdown, which is actually what LLMs prefer.\n\n## Risk\n\nLOW — Backward compatible.

{"id":"developer-ypr","title":"Register PageTitle component override in astro.config.mjs","description":"## What\n\nUpdate astro.config.mjs to tell Starlight to use our custom PageTitle component instead of its built-in default.\n\n## Implementation\n\nIn the `starlight()` configuration object, add `PageTitle` to the `components` map:\n\n```javascript\n// Before:\ncomponents: {\n  Head: './src/components/starlight/Head.astro',\n},\n\n// After:\ncomponents: {\n  Head: './src/components/starlight/Head.astro',\n  PageTitle: './src/components/starlight/PageTitle.astro',\n},\n```\n\n## How Starlight Component Overrides Work\n\nStarlight has a set of built-in components that render different parts of each documentation page (Head, PageTitle, Sidebar, Footer, etc.). By specifying a component path in the `components` config, Starlight renders YOUR component instead of its default.\n\nThe override is complete — Starlight passes all the same props and context (Astro.locals.starlightRoute) to custom components that it passes to its built-in ones. Our PageTitle.astro accesses the page title via `Astro.locals.starlightRoute.entry.data.title`.\n\n## Why This is a Separate Issue\n\nThis is the 'activation' step — without this config change, the PageTitle.astro file exists but is never rendered. Keeping it separate from the component creation makes it easy to:\n- Review the component independently of the config change\n- Quickly disable the feature by reverting just this config line\n- Debug issues by checking 'is the component registered?' vs 'is the component broken?'\n\n## Reference\n\nThe about repo registers this in the same way, along with several other overrides:\n```javascript\n// about repo astro.config.mjs\ncomponents: {\n  Head: './src/components/starlight/Head.astro',\n  SocialIcons: './src/components/NavLink.astro',\n  PageTitle: './src/components/starlight/PageTitle.astro',\n}\n```\n\n## Files\n\n- astro.config.mjs (modify components object)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"j@jlnw.nl","created_at":"2026-02-18T11:58:15.260983396Z","created_by":"Joost van der Laan","updated_at":"2026-02-18T11:58:15.260983396Z","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"developer-ypr","depends_on_id":"developer-exi","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-18T11:58:46.989464892Z","created_by":"Joost van der Laan"},{"issue_id":"developer-ypr","depends_on_id":"developer-8lb","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-18T11:58:54.026171992Z","created_by":"Joost van der Laan"}],"comments":[{"id":9,"issue_id":"developer-ypr","author":"Joost van der Laan","text":"## Cross-References\n- Parent epic: developer-8lb\n- Depends on: developer-exi (PageTitle component)\n- Blocks: developer-dx8 (final verification)\n\n## Starlight Override System Context\nStarlight's component override system works by mapping component names to file paths in the config. The component names correspond to Starlight's internal rendering slots. Available override points include:\n\n- Head, PageTitle, Sidebar, TableOfContents, Footer, Hero, etc.\n\nCurrently, the developer repo only overrides Head (for vtbot view transitions). After this change, it will override both Head and PageTitle.\n\n## Rollback Strategy\nIf the copy-to-markdown feature causes issues in production:\n1. Remove the PageTitle line from astro.config.mjs components\n2. Rebuild and deploy\n3. Starlight reverts to its default PageTitle component\n4. The PageTitle.astro file and constants.ts can remain in the codebase (they're just unused)\n5. The .md endpoint also becomes unused but is harmless\n\nThis single-line config change is the on/off switch for the entire feature.","created_at":"2026-02-18T12:00:24Z"}]}
